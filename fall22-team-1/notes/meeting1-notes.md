##Overall goal
-----------------------

Connect the people who need affordable housing to the resources that exist to prevent people from being priced out.

##Datasets
--------------------------

Primary parcel database — https://data.boston.gov/dataset/property-assessment/resource/4b99718b-d064-471b-9b24-517ae5effecc

We will use this as a baseline. Need to filter out commercial properies, etc...

Tom's database — TBD

Based on the parcel database. Can extend our baseline.

Affordable housing database — https://www.bostonplans.org/housing/finding-housing/property-listings

Database of affordable units in Boston.

Income restricted housing dataset — https://data.boston.gov/dataset/income-restricted-housing

An inventory of income-restricted units in Boston. 

Shape file — TBD

Going to be updated in the next couple weeks. Will involve this dataset later in the project.
